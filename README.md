sticko - A free Ghost theme :)
=======

## About this theme

I've been working as a UI/UX Dev font the last 12 years. I've also been using the web as a huge source of information for my personal and professional career.
[sticko](http://sticko.apps.runkite.com/) is my own way to give back something i love and live for to the internet community: a clean, modern, **responsive** and **free** theme for the emerging -and absolutely amazing- blogging platform called [Ghost](http://ghost.org).

I really hope you like it and feel free to use this theme for whatever purpose you want.

### Installation

* Grab a copy of this repository.
* Place it inside your Ghost installation folder; specifically in `/content/themes/`.
* Restart your Ghost instance.
* Log in the admin panel, go to `Settings > General` and select **sticko** from the Theme dropdown menu. Then hit **Save**.

**Optional:** Set a cover image for your fresh installed blog. If you dont, dont worry; **sticko** comes with a preset cover image.

### Set a cover image for every post

[Ghost](http://ghost.org) does not let you specify a cover/featured image *yet*, but **sticko** allows that functionality just by specifying the proper alt property of the desired image:


`!image[cover-image](url)`.

Open the file `nav.hbs` located in `/partials/` folder.
